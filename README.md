# **Phase field modeling of fracture and fatigue in brittle materials**
***

This is an open source object oriented Python project developed for the simulation of fracture and fatigue in brittle materials via phase field approch. Structure of the subdirectories are:
* /src: all source files are included in this folder
* /examples: benchmark problems 
* /mesh-files: gmsh files for the benchmark problems
