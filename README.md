# **Phase field modeling of fracture and fatigue in brittle materials**
***

This is an open source object oriented Python project developed for the simulation of fracture and fatigue in brittle materials via phase field approch. 

## Structure of the subdirectories
* ./src
  - all source files are included in this folder
* ./examples 
  - benchmark problems 
* ./mesh-files 
  - gmsh files for the benchmark problems

## Instruction
To run any of the benchmark problems, place the related "Main.py" and "input.in" in the root directory, which contains above subdirectories. 

## Structure of the input file
Input file of the phase field analysis is structures as follows:
